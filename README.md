# An Algorithm for Real time Electrocardiography Processing 

**Summary**

- Stream Electrocardiography (ECG) from local PC to an EC2 via pub/sub MQTT protocol
- Signal is processed in window basic to output clean ECG waveform and heart rate values in real time 
- An key algorithm is implemented to calcluate heart rate from ECG signal [Ref](http://cinc.mit.edu/archives/2011/pdf/0625.pdf)
- [video demo](http://cinc.mit.edu/archives/2011/pdf/0625.pdf)
